# Rename Files or Folders Using Lists

Script to rename files or folders/directories based on Excel or .csv list on Windows OS.

To use:

create excel or comma delimited .csv file with columns: 'old_name', 'new_name', 'old_location', 'new_location'

if 'new_location' of the file or folder is different from 'old_location' items will be renamed and Moved

otherwise, - if they are the same, - renamed only.

if any items renaming will fail (for example: in use by other processes, or not found),

the script will create .csv file with the list of failures.
